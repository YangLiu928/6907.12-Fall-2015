## Course Details

### Description
Introduce the components and process involved in developing a full stack web application: Data modeling, Server Side Business Logic, Service Oriented Architecture, Client-side Web Application, Mobile App Development. Also touches upon User Management, Security and Other Network Related Concepts.

### Objective
By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1. take a problem and design a full stack web application architecture;
2. demonstrate andunderstand service-oriented architecture;
3. implement a client side web and/or native mobile app;
4. understand security and operational implications that comes with full-stack application.

### Textbook
There are no required textbooks for this class. However, through out the cource, there will be list of
reference materials for you to read.

### Grading
* 30% - Project Progress Report 
* 50% - Final Project
* 20% - Peer Evaluation

### Group Project
To achieve the objectives above, you will form a group of 4 or 5 students and create a full stack web application.
In the middle of the semester, you'll provide a progress report on you project. And at the end of the semester,
you will give a brief presentation on your final project product. Completing your project as a group will grant you
at most 80% of your final grade. Rest of 20% will come from peer evaluation.
More detailed description of the project will be given ot you through out the course.
